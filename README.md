# Extended Build Storage

This module allows you to store infinite Build Templates

## WORK IN PROGRESS

### WARNING

No Error handling whatsoever at the moment.

Only works with at least 1 Template present in `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Guild Wars 2\addons\blishhud\build-templates`

Just create a file with `templatename.txt` and a random "chatcode" as content (Might get validated after we have chatcode format)
